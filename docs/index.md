# Hello World

Just trying to wrap my head around how to use [readthedocs.org](Read the Docs) for a personal project.

It isn't as entirely straightforward as one thinks.


## Steps

1. `brew install mkdocs`
1. `mkdocs new .` inside a git repository - this will create a `docs/` folder, as well as a `mkdocs.yml` config file that, confusingly, projects using readthedocs don't seem to have on their root directory...
1. Link readthedocs account with that repository (needs to be public).
1. Switch the readthedocs renderer from Sphinx (default) to Mkdocs.

## Issues to be resolved

* What is best, Sphinx or MkDocs? The latter looks to be simpler.
